# Python Technical Test Solution

## Description:
A implementation of the FizzBuzz solution problem that takes two integers between 1 and 100, then prints each number in the range with "Fizz" for numbers divisible by 3 and "Buzz for numbers divisible by 5.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.6+

## Usage:
```zsh
python3 fizzbuzz.py
```

## How to run tests:
```zsh
python3 test_fizzbuzz.py
```

## Features:
- Input validation (ensures numbers are between 1 to 100 and the first number is less than or equal to the second number)
- Error handling with clear messages
- Unit tests to handle both the logic and the error handling
